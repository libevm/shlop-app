## Source of Truth
- `.memory/` holds all project context, architecture, and progress.
- Treat it as authoritative. Don't duplicate specs in this file.

## Workflow
1. Read relevant `.memory/` files before starting work.
2. Implement the change.
3. **Update `.memory/` to reflect the new state.** Change is incomplete without this.
4. If setup/run steps change, update `README.md` in the same change.
