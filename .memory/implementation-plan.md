# Implementation Plan (AI Developer Playbook)

Date: 2026-02-17  
Runtime requirement: **Bun**  
Target architecture: `client/` + `server/` + `tools/build-assets/` + shared schemas

This plan is intentionally granular. Follow steps in order.  
Every step includes:
- an **automated test** (unit/integration/e2e/perf)
- a **debug mode test** (human-in-the-loop verification)

No step is complete unless both pass.

  - Corrected world rendering so facing no longer mirrors the map scene.
  - Corrected character-only flip behavior and anchor-based part placement.
  - Added head composition from `Character.wz/00012000.img.json` and neck-anchor mapping.

    - grounded idle => `stand1`
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
- 2026-02-17: Improved character part composition and enabled rope climbing.
  - Reworked character frame rendering from fixed slots (`body`/`arm`/`hand`) to dynamic per-frame part composition.
  - Added map-vector anchor propagation across parts (fixes jump arm/hand alignment issues and supports `lHand`/`rHand` frames).
  - Added z-order guidance from `Base.wz/zmap.img.json` for more correct part layering.
  - Implemented rope climbing using map `ladderRope` data:
    - `↑`/`↓` to climb when near rope
    - `ladder` action while climbing
    - `Space` jump-off from rope
  - Updated controls text/docs (`client/web/index.html`, `README.md`, phase6 process doc).
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke
- 2026-02-17: Refined jump stance behavior and restored default face rendering.
  - Updated airborne stance selection to use `jump` only (removed `fly` mapping).
  - Added default face asset loading from `Character.wz/Face/00020000.img.json`.
  - Composed face via `brow` anchor when frame `face` flag is enabled.
  - Improved part placement robustness by iterating pending parts until anchor dependencies are satisfied.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke
- 2026-02-17: Added blink animation and improved traversal collision edge cases.
  - Added periodic face blink cycle driven by face frame delays (`default` -> `blink` -> `default`).
  - Fixed rope-top transition by snapping to nearby foothold when climbing up reaches `y1`.
  - Added vertical-wall collision from foothold geometry to stop easy wall passthrough at map edges.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke
- 2026-02-17: Adjusted wall blocker policy to only prevent out-of-bounds fall-through.
  - Updated wall collision to apply only for grounded crossing attempts.
  - Added foothold probe below destination side of wall crossing.
  - If foothold exists below, crossing is allowed (internal wall pass-through preserved).
  - If no foothold exists below, crossing is blocked (map-edge fall protection).
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke
- 2026-02-17: Refined ladder input semantics for side-jump behavior.
  - While attached to rope/ladder, lateral inputs no longer produce walk/detach drift.
  - `←`/`→` now explicitly trigger side jump-off from rope/ladder.
  - `Space` jump-off behavior retained.
  - Updated user-facing controls text in web UI + README.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke
- 2026-02-17: Fixed prone pose disappearing + aligned map/character layer ordering closer to C++ Stage behavior.
  - Reference scan findings captured from read-only code:
    - C++ `PlayerClimbState` uses jump+walk-input side detach semantics.
    - C++ `Stage::draw` renders by map layer (tiles/objs first, then chars) so higher layers can appear in front of the player.
    - Half-web TS `prone` action frame in `Character.wz/00002000.img.json` uses UOL links (`../../proneStab/0/body`, `../../proneStab/0/arm`) rather than direct `$canvas` children.
  - Implemented web-client frame-part UOL resolution for character action frames.
  - Added foothold layer tracking and map-layer interleaved character rendering.
  - Result: prone now renders correctly; foreground map layers can occlude character as expected.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Fixed edge-lock regression so walking off foothold ends allows falling when no wall blocks movement.
  - Reference scan findings captured from read-only code:
    - Half-web TS physics (`MapleWeb/TypeScript-Client/src/Physics.ts`) allows edge fall-through when next/prev link is missing or non-blocking vertical foothold.
    - Half-web TS blocks only specific edge-connected wall orientations:
      - right edge blocked when `next` is vertical and `next.y1 > next.y2`
      - left edge blocked when `prev` is vertical and `prev.y1 < prev.y2`
    - C++ foothold tree uses explicit wall/edge limiting logic instead of blanket drop-locking.
  - Updated web debug client foothold linking/parsing and wall resolution:
    - treat `prev/next` value `0` as no-link (`null`)
    - replace generic destination-side drop probe lock with foothold-link edge blocking logic
    - allow natural edge drop when no blocking wall exists
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Refined rope/ladder interaction semantics and render layering.
  - Reference scan findings captured from read-only code:
    - C++ `PlayerClimbState` jump-off requires `JUMP` + walk input (`haswalkinput(player)`).
    - Half-web TS climbing update confirms ladder stance + climb movement semantics while attached.
  - Updated web debug client rope/ladder behavior in `client/web/app.js`:
    - ropes/ladders are now rendered behind the character (`drawRopeGuides()` before map/character draw pass)
    - while climbing, jump-off now requires **Space + (←/→)** together
    - while climbing, `Space` alone and `←/→` alone do nothing
    - pressing `↑` at top no longer re-attaches/teleports to rope start (attach gated by `player.y > rope.y1 + 6`)
    - pressing `↓` while not already attached no longer starts climbing (only `↑` can attach)
  - Updated user-facing controls text:
    - `client/web/index.html`
    - `README.md`
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Ported key C++ ladder/foothold/wall semantics into web debug client movement loop.
  - Read-only C++ reference review completed for:
    - `Gameplay/Physics/Foothold{.h,.cpp}`
    - `Gameplay/Physics/FootholdTree.cpp`
    - `Gameplay/MapleMap/MapInfo{.h,.cpp}`
    - `Character/PlayerStates.cpp`, `Character/Player.cpp`
    - `Gameplay/Stage.cpp` ladder-check callsites
  - Implemented parity-focused behavior in `client/web/app.js`:
    - foothold-derived map wall/border ranges (`left+25/right-25`, `top-300/bottom+100`)
    - wall blocking using two-hop foothold checks by vertical overlap (`get_wall` style)
    - ladder range checks using ±10 px horizontal and ±5 y probe (`inrange` semantics)
    - ladder fall-off detection using C++ `felloff` logic
    - climb cooldown (~1000ms) after ladder cancel/jump-off
    - climb jump-off remains `Space + walk input`
    - top-of-ladder `↓` attach-and-climb-down restored (C++ `check_ladders(false)` style)
  - Updated controls text to reflect top-of-ladder down-climb attach behavior.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Corrected airborne wall collision parity (jumping into wall now blocks horizontal advance).
  - Root cause:
    - wall-limiting path was gated to grounded movement only.
    - C++ `FootholdTree::limit_movement` applies horizontal wall limiting whenever object is horizontally mobile, including airborne states.
  - Fix in `client/web/app.js`:
    - removed grounded-only gate from `resolveWallCollision`
    - added foothold-below lookup for airborne wall context (mirrors `get_fhid_below` intent)
    - wall collision now resolves against foothold-linked walls during jumps/falls as well
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)

## Required Debug Playbook (must stay up-to-date)

Maintain a human-readable debug playbook with at least these flows:
1. Start client + server + pipeline output.
2. Warp to map by ID.
3. Spawn/despawn mobs and NPCs.
4. Simulate packet latency/loss.
5. Open two clients and verify multiplayer sync.
6. Trigger combat (melee + ranged), drops, and effects.
7. Send chat and verify bubbles/log.
8. Inspect API/cache metrics and asset lookup logs.
9. Force error cases (missing asset, bad packet, server restart).
10. Capture evidence bundle for any failed flow.

If any playbook flow fails, treat release as blocked.
