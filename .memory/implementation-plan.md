# Implementation Plan (AI Developer Playbook)

Date: 2026-02-17  
Runtime requirement: **Bun**  
Target architecture: `client/` + `server/` + `tools/build-assets/` + shared schemas

This plan is intentionally granular. Follow steps in order.  
Every step includes:
- an **automated test** (unit/integration/e2e/perf)
- a **debug mode test** (human-in-the-loop verification)

No step is complete unless both pass.

  - Corrected world rendering so facing no longer mirrors the map scene.
  - Corrected character-only flip behavior and anchor-based part placement.
  - Added head composition from `Character.wz/00012000.img.json` and neck-anchor mapping.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` (manual map route smoke)
- 2026-02-17: Added airborne stance animation switching.
  - Updated offline web client action selection logic:
    - rising => `jump`
    - descending => `fly`
    - grounded moving => `walk1`
    - grounded idle => `stand1`
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
- 2026-02-17: Improved character part composition and enabled rope climbing.
  - Reworked character frame rendering from fixed slots (`body`/`arm`/`hand`) to dynamic per-frame part composition.
  - Added map-vector anchor propagation across parts (fixes jump arm/hand alignment issues and supports `lHand`/`rHand` frames).
  - Added z-order guidance from `Base.wz/zmap.img.json` for more correct part layering.
  - Implemented rope climbing using map `ladderRope` data:
    - `↑`/`↓` to climb when near rope
    - `ladder` action while climbing
    - `Space` jump-off from rope
  - Updated controls text/docs (`client/web/index.html`, `README.md`, phase6 process doc).
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke
- 2026-02-17: Refined jump stance behavior and restored default face rendering.
  - Updated airborne stance selection to use `jump` only (removed `fly` mapping).
  - Added default face asset loading from `Character.wz/Face/00020000.img.json`.
  - Composed face via `brow` anchor when frame `face` flag is enabled.
  - Improved part placement robustness by iterating pending parts until anchor dependencies are satisfied.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke
- 2026-02-17: Added blink animation and improved traversal collision edge cases.
  - Added periodic face blink cycle driven by face frame delays (`default` -> `blink` -> `default`).
  - Fixed rope-top transition by snapping to nearby foothold when climbing up reaches `y1`.
  - Added vertical-wall collision from foothold geometry to stop easy wall passthrough at map edges.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke
- 2026-02-17: Adjusted wall blocker policy to only prevent out-of-bounds fall-through.
  - Updated wall collision to apply only for grounded crossing attempts.
  - Added foothold probe below destination side of wall crossing.
  - If foothold exists below, crossing is allowed (internal wall pass-through preserved).
  - If no foothold exists below, crossing is blocked (map-edge fall protection).
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke
- 2026-02-17: Refined ladder input semantics for side-jump behavior.
  - While attached to rope/ladder, lateral inputs no longer produce walk/detach drift.
  - `←`/`→` now explicitly trigger side jump-off from rope/ladder.
  - `Space` jump-off behavior retained.
  - Updated user-facing controls text in web UI + README.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke
- 2026-02-17: Fixed prone pose disappearing + aligned map/character layer ordering closer to C++ Stage behavior.
  - Reference scan findings captured from read-only code:
    - C++ `PlayerClimbState` uses jump+walk-input side detach semantics.
    - C++ `Stage::draw` renders by map layer (tiles/objs first, then chars) so higher layers can appear in front of the player.
    - Half-web TS `prone` action frame in `Character.wz/00002000.img.json` uses UOL links (`../../proneStab/0/body`, `../../proneStab/0/arm`) rather than direct `$canvas` children.
  - Implemented web-client frame-part UOL resolution for character action frames.
  - Added foothold layer tracking and map-layer interleaved character rendering.
  - Result: prone now renders correctly; foreground map layers can occlude character as expected.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Fixed edge-lock regression so walking off foothold ends allows falling when no wall blocks movement.
  - Reference scan findings captured from read-only code:
    - Half-web TS physics (`MapleWeb/TypeScript-Client/src/Physics.ts`) allows edge fall-through when next/prev link is missing or non-blocking vertical foothold.
    - Half-web TS blocks only specific edge-connected wall orientations:
      - right edge blocked when `next` is vertical and `next.y1 > next.y2`
      - left edge blocked when `prev` is vertical and `prev.y1 < prev.y2`
    - C++ foothold tree uses explicit wall/edge limiting logic instead of blanket drop-locking.
  - Updated web debug client foothold linking/parsing and wall resolution:
    - treat `prev/next` value `0` as no-link (`null`)
    - replace generic destination-side drop probe lock with foothold-link edge blocking logic
    - allow natural edge drop when no blocking wall exists
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Refined rope/ladder interaction semantics and render layering.
  - Reference scan findings captured from read-only code:
    - C++ `PlayerClimbState` jump-off requires `JUMP` + walk input (`haswalkinput(player)`).
    - Half-web TS climbing update confirms ladder stance + climb movement semantics while attached.
  - Updated web debug client rope/ladder behavior in `client/web/app.js`:
    - ropes/ladders are now rendered behind the character (`drawRopeGuides()` before map/character draw pass)
    - while climbing, jump-off now requires **Space + (←/→)** together
    - while climbing, `Space` alone and `←/→` alone do nothing
    - pressing `↑` at top no longer re-attaches/teleports to rope start (attach gated by `player.y > rope.y1 + 6`)
    - pressing `↓` while not already attached no longer starts climbing (only `↑` can attach)
  - Updated user-facing controls text:
    - `client/web/index.html`
    - `README.md`
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Ported key C++ ladder/foothold/wall semantics into web debug client movement loop.
  - Read-only C++ reference review completed for:
    - `Gameplay/Physics/Foothold{.h,.cpp}`
    - `Gameplay/Physics/FootholdTree.cpp`
    - `Gameplay/MapleMap/MapInfo{.h,.cpp}`
    - `Character/PlayerStates.cpp`, `Character/Player.cpp`
    - `Gameplay/Stage.cpp` ladder-check callsites
  - Implemented parity-focused behavior in `client/web/app.js`:
    - foothold-derived map wall/border ranges (`left+25/right-25`, `top-300/bottom+100`)
    - wall blocking using two-hop foothold checks by vertical overlap (`get_wall` style)
    - ladder range checks using ±10 px horizontal and ±5 y probe (`inrange` semantics)
    - ladder fall-off detection using C++ `felloff` logic
    - climb cooldown (~1000ms) after ladder cancel/jump-off
    - climb jump-off remains `Space + walk input`
    - top-of-ladder `↓` attach-and-climb-down restored (C++ `check_ladders(false)` style)
  - Updated controls text to reflect top-of-ladder down-climb attach behavior.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Corrected airborne wall collision parity (jumping into wall now blocks horizontal advance).
  - Root cause:
    - wall-limiting path was gated to grounded movement only.
    - C++ `FootholdTree::limit_movement` applies horizontal wall limiting whenever object is horizontally mobile, including airborne states.
  - Fix in `client/web/app.js`:
    - removed grounded-only gate from `resolveWallCollision`
    - added foothold-below lookup for airborne wall context (mirrors `get_fhid_below` intent)
    - wall collision now resolves against foothold-linked walls during jumps/falls as well
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Updated rope/ladder visual layering per latest request.
  - Changed render order so rope/ladder guides are drawn after map+character pass.
  - Result: rope/ladder lines now render in front of the character.
  - File: `client/web/app.js`
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Switched climbing animation to rope-specific action when attached to rope.
  - Updated action selection in `client/web/app.js`:
    - climbing on ladder (`l=1`) -> `ladder` action
    - climbing on rope (`l=0`) -> `rope` action (fallback to `ladder` if `rope` frames unavailable)
  - Confirmed interactable overlay layering remains aligned with C++ stage intent:
    - back backgrounds first
    - map/interactable passes
    - foreground backgrounds last (only explicitly-front content overlays)
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=100020000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Updated default map ID for web debug client startup.
  - Default map changed from `100020000` to `104040000`.
  - Updated files:
    - `client/web/index.html` (default form input)
    - `client/web/app.js` (fallback `initialMapId`)
    - `README.md` (default URL)
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /` => 200, `GET /resources/Map.wz/Map/Map1/104040000.img.json` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Adjusted object/rope/character draw ordering per latest layering feedback.
  - Updated render order in `client/web/app.js`:
    - map layers and interactable objects render before character
    - rope/ladder guides render before character
    - character now renders after those objects
  - Removed character interleave-in-layer draw path from `drawMapLayers()`.
  - Added object sorting by map `z` value within each layer to better mirror C++ `TilesObjs` z-bucket ordering.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Fixed incline foothold traversal so player follows uneven platforms instead of falling through.
  - Reference alignment target:
    - C++ `FootholdTree::update_fh` keeps grounded objects snapped to foothold ground and transitions to linked footholds when crossing edges.
  - Updated web client movement logic in `client/web/app.js`:
    - added slope-ground projection (`groundYOnFoothold`) for grounded horizontal movement
    - added linked foothold traversal resolver (`resolveFootholdForX`) for prev/next foothold transitions
    - split grounded-vs-airborne integration path so gravity is only applied when not grounded
    - preserved wall limiting via `resolveWallCollision` while grounded and airborne
  - Result:
    - walking up/down inclined footholds now tracks ground height properly
    - no immediate fall-through on uneven surfaces
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Added deeper C++-style foothold edge/slope transition handling for uneven surfaces.
  - Reference alignment details from `FootholdTree::update_fh`:
    - edge crossing checks use `floor(x) > r` and `ceil(x) < l`
    - prev/next transitions should follow linked footholds rather than dropping immediately
    - wall-adjacent linked footholds should clamp movement instead of causing ground-loss flicker
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - `resolveFootholdForX` now uses floor/ceil edge logic and multi-step linked traversal
    - wall-adjacent transitions now clamp `x` to foothold edge and keep grounded state
    - `findFootholdBelow` now includes small tolerance (`minY - 1`) to reduce precision loss on slope snaps
  - Result:
    - improved continuity over chained uneven footholds
    - reduced slope edge drop-through and wall-edge ground loss
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Tuned rope margin and added C++-style rope-jump/down-jump behavior refinements.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - rope/ladder attach horizontal margin increased slightly (`±12`) so player need not be pixel-perfect on rope X
    - rope side jump now uses reduced vertical launch (`vy=-360`) to mirror C++ climb jump (`-jumpforce/1.5`) behavior
    - added down-jump flow on foothold when pressing `jump + down` and foothold exists below within 600px (C++ `enablejd/groundbelow` style)
      - sets position just below current ground (`ground + 1`), enters fall, then lands on below foothold
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Refined down-jump gating + foothold-edge release behavior.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - down-jump now strictly requires a **different** foothold below current foothold within 600px
    - down-jump now applies a small hop impulse (`vy=-190`) to better match expected visual hop/fall transition
    - down-jump horizontal speed forced to zero for consistent drop-through behavior
    - adjusted edge traversal to avoid clamping on non-blocking wall-linked edges, reducing "stuck at foothold end" cases
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Fixed down-jump landing exclusion and ladder-facing stabilization.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - climbing now locks to default facing sprite (`facing=-1`) and remains centered on rope x-axis
    - down-jump now marks current foothold as temporarily excluded landing target (prevents re-landing on same foothold after hop)
    - landing checks now honor exclusion window (`~260ms`) for down-jump pass-through reliability
    - down-jump detection now excludes current foothold when searching for a valid foothold below
  - Result:
    - down+jump can again reach lower foothold reliably when available
    - down+jump with no valid below foothold falls back to normal jump instead of silent prone no-op
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Fixed angled-jump landings on uneven footholds (swept landing collision).
  - Root cause:
    - landing detection used end-of-frame x only, so diagonal motion could miss sloped foothold intersections.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - replaced scalar x-based landing check with swept segment intersection (`oldX,oldY -> newX,newY` vs foothold segment)
    - keeps down-jump exclusion support via optional foothold exclusion parameter
  - Result:
    - jumping diagonally into inclined footholds now lands reliably instead of passing through.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Fixed rope alignment offset and mid-air ladder re-attach behavior.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - added climb snap offset (`x = rope.x - 1`) to correct ~1px right drift while climbing
    - allowed climb re-attach while airborne even during climb cooldown (supports re-grabbing ladder mid-jump)
  - Result:
    - climbing sprite appears centered on rope/ladder
    - jumping off mid-ladder can re-attach mid-air when pressing climb input
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Relaxed down-climb attach detection around ladders/ropes.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js` (`ladderInRange`):
    - keeps climb-up attach behavior unchanged
    - broadens climb-down attach envelope to allow "around ladder" captures:
      - horizontal margin `±16` (down) vs `±12` (up)
      - vertical buffer for down attach (`top -18`, `bottom +12`)
  - Result:
    - pressing down to climb from near/around ladder top is less strict and more forgiving.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Increased down-climb horizontal capture margin further.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js` (`ladderInRange`):
    - climb-down horizontal margin increased from `±16` to `±20`
  - Result:
    - easier ladder/rope down-climb attach when player is near (not exactly centered) around ladder x-axis.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Added minimum short reattach lock after ladder/rope jump-off.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - new `reattachLockUntil` timer on player state
    - set `reattachLockUntil = now + 200ms` when jump-off/canceling climb
    - attach checks now require lock to expire before re-climbing
    - retains airborne reattach support after lock window (prevents instant same-frame regrab)
  - Note: C++ uses a larger climb cooldown (`set_climb_cooldown(1000ms)`); this tuned value follows requested short lock behavior while preserving mid-air regrab flow.

- 2026-02-17: Scoped reattach lock to same rope only.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - added `reattachLockRopeKey` tracking on detach
    - reattach lock now blocks only if candidate rope matches detached rope key
    - jumping across to a different rope can reattach immediately (even within lock window)
    - same-rope reattach still waits 200ms

- 2026-02-17: Fixed input/down-jump/background/portal regressions and improved interaction gating.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - `jump + down` now always ignores lateral movement input (`vx=0`)
    - `jump + down` with no valid foothold below now performs no jump (stays grounded, no upward jump)
    - increased facial animation playback speed (faster blink cadence + lower per-frame delays)
    - fixed background/scenery/cloud loading by handling `Back/*.img` `back/ani` direct `$canvas` children
    - added animated portal rendering from `Map.wz/MapHelper.img.json` (`pv/ph/psh`) and integrated into render pass
    - keyboard gameplay input now only works when canvas is entered/focused/clicked; input resets on leave/blur
  - Updated `client/web/index.html`:
    - made canvas focusable via `tabindex="0"` for focus-based keyboard gating
  - Updated `README.md`:
    - added controls note that keyboard input requires canvas hover/focus

- 2026-02-17: Fixed jump SFX parity against C++ and surfaced active SFX in debug panel.
  - Reference scan (read-only) findings:
    - C++ `Character/PlayerStates.cpp`: `play_jumpsound()` is used for stand/walk/down-jump and ladder jump-off.
    - C++ `Audio/Audio.cpp`: `Sound::Name::JUMP` maps to `Sound.wz/Game.img/Jump`.
    - Half web reference `TypeScript-Client/src/MapleCharacter.ts`: jump also uses `Sound.wz/Game.img/Jump`.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - replaced jump-related SFX trigger from `Game/Portal2` to `Game/Jump` for:
      - normal ground jump
      - down-jump
      - rope/ladder jump-off
    - added debug audio telemetry (`runtime.audioDebug`) and included audio section in map summary panel:
      - `currentBgm`
      - `lastSfx`
      - `lastSfxAgeMs`
      - `sfxPlayCount`
  - Validation status:

- 2026-02-17: Locked horizontal movement during successful down-jump until landing.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - added player state flags:
      - `downJumpControlLock`
      - `downJumpTargetFootholdId`
    - on successful `jump + down`, movement lock now activates and records target foothold below
    - while lock is active and airborne, left/right input is ignored (`effectiveMove = 0`)
    - lock clears on landing (or reset paths: map load/respawn/other jump paths)
    - exposed lock state in debug panel summary under `player.downJumpControlLock` and `player.downJumpTargetFootholdId`
  - Behavior result:
    - after `jump + down`, user cannot apply directional input until landing on the next foothold.
  - Validation status:

- 2026-02-17: Reworked background rendering to follow C++ tiling/parallax behavior (fixes dark scene patches).
  - Reference scan (read-only) findings:
    - C++ `Gameplay/MapleMap/MapBackgrounds.cpp`:
      - uses `type` to derive horizontal/vertical tiling counts (`VWIDTH/cx + 3`, `VHEIGHT/cy + 3`)
      - uses `rx/ry` for parallax or motion depending on background type
      - supports per-frame alpha (`a0/a1`) and animated background frames
      - can fill black when map background root is marked empty (`black`)
    - C++ stage draw order confirms backgrounds are drawn in a dedicated pass before map layers (`Gameplay/Stage.cpp`).
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - expanded parsed background metadata: `index`, `type`, `rx`, `ry`, `cx`, `cy`, `flipped`
    - added map-level `blackBackground` detection from back index `0`
    - replaced single-canvas background draw path with source/frame loader:
      - resolves direct `$canvas` and frame children for `Back/*.img`
      - caches frame metadata and images
      - supports animated frame delays + `a0/a1` blending
    - implemented C++-style screen-space background draw behavior:
      - type-driven tiling coverage (horizontal/vertical/both)
      - parallax/motion handling based on `type` + `rx/ry`
      - origin and flip-aware placement for each tile
      - optional black screen fill for black-background maps
  - Expected behavior result:
    - background layers now continuously cover the viewport (no intermittent dark patch gaps) and track camera more faithfully.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Fixed regression where scene stopped rendering after background renderer overhaul.
  - Root issue:
    - new full background pipeline introduced a runtime regression causing map scene to disappear.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - restored stable background meta loading path (`requestBackgroundMeta`) so scene renders reliably again
    - kept background schema enrichment (`type/cx/cy/rx/ry/flipped`) from C++ parity pass
    - added safe tiled background repetition based on `type` + `cx/cy` to reduce uncovered dark patches without breaking core render
    - fixed flipped draw call to pass `{ flipped: background.flipped }` into `drawWorldImage`
  - Behavior result:
    - scene rendering restored
    - tiled backgrounds now cover viewport more consistently
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Corrected portal visibility/type mapping to match C++ semantics.
  - Reference scan (read-only) findings:
    - C++ `Gameplay/MapleMap/Portal.cpp`: hidden portals (`type == HIDDEN`, id 10) draw only when touched by player bounds.
    - C++ `Gameplay/MapleMap/MapPortals.cpp`: regular portal animation uses `pv`; hidden uses `ph/default/portalContinue`.
    - Half web `TypeScript-Client/src/Portal.ts`: visible/invisible type gating differs by `pt`; regular uses `pv`.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - portal map parsing now stores `id` and `image`
    - removed incorrect style mapping that swapped regular/hidden visuals
    - added type-aware portal render policy:
      - draw always: `2`, `4`, `7` (and `11` scripted hidden style)
      - draw only when touched: `10` hidden
      - do not draw: spawn/invisible/touch-only and other non-visual types
    - portal assets now loaded by C++-style paths:
      - regular: `portal/game/pv`
      - hidden: `portal/game/ph/default/portalContinue`
      - scripted hidden: `portal/game/psh/<image>/portalContinue` (fallback `default`)
  - Behavior result:
    - visible portals now render correctly
    - hidden portals no longer render unless player is inside portal touch bounds.

- 2026-02-17: Mitigated intermittent one-frame character disappearance (render blip).
  - Root cause:
    - `drawCharacter()` skipped rendering when current animation frame body image was not yet ready in cache.
    - this could occur transiently on frame/action transitions and appear as instant vanish/reappear.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - added `runtime.lastRenderableCharacterFrame` fallback state
    - refactored character composition into `composeCharacterPlacements(action, frameIndex, player, flipped)`
    - `drawCharacter()` now:
      - tries current frame composition first
      - falls back to last renderable frame when current frame is temporarily unavailable
      - updates fallback state once current frame is renderable again
    - resets fallback state on map load
  - Behavior result:
    - transient asset-load frame gaps no longer cause visible character blips.

- 2026-02-17: Clamped horizontal camera render range to foothold extents.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - map parsing now stores `footholdBounds` (`minX`/`maxX`) derived from foothold endpoints
    - `updateCamera()` now clamps `camera.x` to `[footholdMinX + viewportHalfWidth, footholdMaxX - viewportHalfWidth]`
    - when map foothold width is narrower than viewport, camera centers on foothold midpoint
    - debug summary now includes `footholdBounds`
  - Behavior result:
    - horizontal view no longer scrolls/renders beyond leftmost/rightmost foothold extents.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Added C++-inspired slope takeoff adjustment for normal jumps.
  - Reference scan (read-only) findings:
    - C++ `Physics::move_normal()` applies slope/friction term using:
      - `FRICTION = 0.5`
      - `SLOPEFACTOR = 0.1`
      - `GROUNDSLIP = 3.0`
      - clamped slope contribution (`[-0.5, 0.5]`)
    - C++ `Foothold::slope()` is `vdelta / hdelta`; this influences on-ground horizontal behavior before/at takeoff.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - added constants mirroring C++ normal-ground slope drag params
    - added helpers:
      - `footholdSlope(foothold)`
      - `applyCppGroundSlopeDrag(hspeed, slope)`
    - on normal jump (non down-jump), apply C++-style slope drag to `player.vx` at takeoff when standing on sloped foothold
  - Behavior result:
    - jump-off from slopes now carries a more C++-like horizontal takeoff response instead of flat constant launch speed.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Added downslope "push away" impulse on slope jump-off to mirror C++ feel in simplified web physics.
  - Context:
    - web debug client still uses simplified ground movement (direct vx assignment), so C++ continuous slope/inertia effects are underrepresented at jump takeoff.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - added `applySlopeJumpTakeoffVelocity(hspeed, slope, moveDir)`
      - starts from C++-style slope drag computation
      - if no horizontal input and slope jump would otherwise be near-stationary, applies a downslope impulse (`slope * 120`) to push character away from incline
    - normal jump path now uses this helper instead of slope-drag-only helper
  - Behavior result:
    - jumping from sloped footholds now includes visible away-from-slope horizontal push even without held left/right, matching expected C++ feel more closely.

    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Added C++-style background parallax for scene/cloud layers.
  - Reference scan (read-only) findings:
    - C++ `Gameplay/MapleMap/MapBackgrounds.cpp`:
      - background draw uses `rx/ry` parallax offsets relative to view position
      - moving background types (`4/5/6/7`) use continuous motion (`hspeed = rx/16`, `vspeed = ry/16`)
      - tiled types derive repeat counts from viewport dimensions and `cx/cy`
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - reworked `drawBackgroundLayer()` into screen-space parallax renderer
    - implemented type-aware parallax/motion for scene/cloud backgrounds:
      - static parallax: `rx/ry` shift based on camera/view offset
      - moving backgrounds: continuous drift for `HMOVE*/VMOVE*` types
    - preserved C++-style tiled repeat coverage (`+3` margin) using `cx/cy`
    - added `drawScreenImage()` helper for flip-aware screen-space background draws
    - enabled black fill for maps marked with empty background set (`blackBackground`) on back layer pass
  - Behavior result:
    - scene and cloud layers now move with depth/parallax instead of fixed camera lock.

- 2026-02-17: Added blocking loading screen with progress bar until required map assets are ready.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - extended asset loaders to support awaited preloading:
      - `requestMeta()` now returns a promise and caches loaded metadata
      - `requestImageByKey()` now returns a promise and caches loaded images
      - extracted async loaders for background/tile/object/portal metadata
    - added map preload pipeline:
      - `buildMapAssetPreloadTasks(map)` for map scene assets (backgrounds, tiles, objects, portal frames)
      - `addCharacterPreloadTasks(...)` for initial character action assets
      - `preloadMapAssets(map, loadToken)` with concurrent workers and live progress updates
    - added runtime loading state and race-safe map load tokening:
      - `runtime.loading` (`active/total/loaded/progress/label`)
      - `runtime.mapLoadToken` to avoid stale async load updates
    - added `drawLoadingScreen()` and made `render()` block world draw while loading is active
    - updated `loadMap()` to await preloading before finalizing map ready state/BGM/play controls message
    - debug summary now includes `loading` progress fields
  - Behavior result:
    - users now see a loading screen/progress bar and the world only appears when required assets are loaded.

    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Added UI checkbox to toggle debug overlay drawings (footholds/ropes/markers).
  - Updated `client/web/index.html`:
    - added `#debug-overlay-toggle` checkbox (default checked)
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - added `runtime.debugOverlayEnabled` state (synced from checkbox)
    - `render()` now conditionally draws `drawRopeGuides()` and `drawFootholdsAndMarkers()` based on toggle state
    - added checkbox change listener to enable/disable overlay at runtime
    - debug summary now includes `debug.overlayEnabled`
  - Behavior result:
    - user can disable in-canvas debug drawings without affecting normal scene/character/portal rendering.

    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Created dedicated debug panel section and split overlay controls into independent toggles.
  - Updated `client/web/index.html`:
    - moved debug controls/log area into dedicated `<aside id="debug-panel">`
    - added separate toggles:
      - `Enable overlay` (`#debug-overlay-toggle`)
      - `Ropes` (`#debug-ropes-toggle`)
      - `Footholds` (`#debug-footholds-toggle`)
      - `Life markers` (`#debug-life-toggle`)
    - kept `#map-summary` inside this debug panel as the live logs/state view
  - Updated `client/web/styles.css`:
    - added dedicated debug panel/toggle styling for clearer separation from gameplay canvas
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - replaced single debug flag with structured runtime debug state:
      - `debug.overlayEnabled`
      - `debug.showRopes`
      - `debug.showFootholds`
      - `debug.showLifeMarkers`
    - split debug drawing functions:
      - `drawFootholdOverlay()`
      - `drawLifeMarkers()`
    - render now gates each overlay independently by toggle state
    - checkbox synchronization helper `syncDebugTogglesFromUi()` keeps runtime/debug UI in sync and disables sub-toggles when overlay master is off
    - debug summary now includes all toggle states
  - Behavior result:
    - debug tools/logs now live in a dedicated section and each overlay category can be toggled independently.

    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Implemented portal "up key" interaction (intramap + intermap warps) per C++ behavior.
  - Reference scan (read-only) findings:
    - C++ `Stage::check_portals()` uses portal bounds + cooldown and supports:
      - intramap warp to target portal name
      - intermap warp to target map id
    - C++ `MapPortals::WARPCD` is short (~48 ticks) to avoid repeated immediate warp spam.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - added portal interaction state:
      - `runtime.portalCooldownUntil`
      - `runtime.portalWarpInProgress`
    - added portal helpers:
      - `findUsablePortalAtPlayer(map)`
      - `movePlayerToPortalInCurrentMap(targetPortalName)`
      - `tryUsePortal()`
    - update loop now calls `tryUsePortal()` so holding/pressing `↑` while in portal bounds triggers warp
    - added short cooldown (`~400ms`) between portal uses
    - extended `loadMap(mapId, spawnPortalName)` so intermap warps can spawn at target portal name when present
  - Behavior result:
    - pressing `↑` on a valid portal now warps player either within the same map (to `tn`) or to destination map (`tm`).
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Hardened portal `↑` interaction and restored layer-aware occlusion for map objects in front of player.
  - Reference scan (read-only) findings:
    - C++ `Stage::update` calls `check_portals()` during `UP` key handling and uses portal bounds/cooldown (`Stage.cpp`, `MapPortals.h/.cpp`, `Portal.cpp`).
    - C++ map drawing is layer-interleaved (`Stage::draw`), allowing higher map layers to render in front of player.
    - C++/half-web map tile/object ordering relies on WZ z fields (`Obj::z`, tile `z` / `zM`).
  - Updated `client/web/app.js` (portal reliability):
    - added portal target helpers:
      - `isValidPortalTargetMapId(...)`
      - `normalizedPortalTargetName(...)`
    - broadened usable-portal detection to include named same-map destinations even when `tm` is script-invalid
    - `tryUsePortal(force = false)` now:
      - supports immediate keydown-triggered attempts (`force`)
      - runs before movement each frame (prevents missing portal due same-frame movement)
      - supports intramap fallback by `tn`
      - falls back to `info.returnMap` when portal has no valid direct map target
      - ignores placeholder portal target names like `N/A`
    - keydown handler now invokes `tryUsePortal(true)` on `↑/W`
  - Updated `client/web/app.js` (front-object rendering):
    - map parsing now captures and sorts by z metadata from dump:
      - tiles: `zM` + stable tie by node id
      - objects: `z` + stable tie by node id
    - replaced monolithic `drawMapLayers()` with:
      - `drawMapLayer(layer)`
      - `drawMapLayersWithCharacter()` (draws character at current foothold layer, fallback once if unresolved)
    - render pass now uses layer-interleaved map/character draw so higher layers can occlude player.
  - Behavior result:
    - pressing `↑` on portal bounds now triggers destination changes more reliably (same-map warp, target map warp, or return-map fallback).
    - foreground layer objects/tiles now appear in front of character when layer/z ordering dictates.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Added portal transfer spawn offset and fade in/out transition for cross-map portal travel.
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - added portal transition constants:
      - `PORTAL_SPAWN_Y_OFFSET = 24`
      - `PORTAL_FADE_OUT_MS = 180`
      - `PORTAL_FADE_IN_MS = 240`
    - added runtime transition state: `runtime.transition` (`alpha`, `active`)
    - added fade helpers:
      - `waitForAnimationFrame()`
      - `fadeScreenTo(targetAlpha, durationMs)`
      - `runPortalMapTransition(targetMapId, targetPortalName)`
    - `tryUsePortal()` now uses `runPortalMapTransition(...)` for cross-map portal transfers (`tm` and `returnMap` fallback)
    - `loadMap(...)` extended to accept `spawnFromPortalTransfer` and apply destination spawn Y offset above portal
    - added `drawTransitionOverlay()` and applied overlay in `render()` for both loading and world draw paths
    - debug summary now reports `transitionAlpha` and `portalWarpInProgress`
  - Behavior result:
    - entering portal to another map fades out, loads, then fades in.
    - arrival position is slightly above destination portal to reduce bumpy foothold under-spawn issues.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`
    - ✅ `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` route smoke (`GET /?mapId=104040000` => 200)
- 2026-02-17: Updated airborne render-layer selection so character front/behind ordering reacts during jumps.
  - Reference scan (read-only) findings:
    - C++ foothold tree updates current foothold candidate via `get_fhid_below(x, y)` every physics tick (`FootholdTree::update_fh`).
    - C++ player draw layer uses character foothold-layer state (`Char::get_layer`, `Stage::draw` interleaving).
  - Updated `client/web/app.js`:
    - added `currentPlayerRenderLayer()`:
      - uses climb layer `7` while climbing
      - otherwise probes nearest foothold below player each frame via `findFootholdBelow(...)`
      - falls back to persisted `player.footholdLayer` if no foothold is found
    - `drawMapLayersWithCharacter()` now uses `currentPlayerRenderLayer()` instead of only settled foothold layer
    - debug summary now includes `player.renderLayer` in addition to `player.footholdLayer`
  - Behavior result:
    - while jumping/falling, player front/behind ordering now updates against map layers before landing.
  - Validation status:
    - ✅ `bun run ci`

## Phase 0 — Delivery Safety, Debug Mode, and Observability

### Step 1 — Define global Definition of Done (DoD)
**Actions**
1. Create a single DoD checklist used by all AI developers.
2. Include mandatory checks: schema validation, automated tests, debug-mode verification, logs inspected, `.memory` updated.
3. Add required evidence format (screenshots/log snippets/test reports).

**Validation**
- **Automated:** Add a repository policy check that fails if PR/task output does not include DoD evidence fields.
- **Debug mode:** Human reviews one sample completed task and confirms all evidence sections are present and understandable.

### Step 2 — Add unified logging conventions
**Actions**
1. Standardize log levels across client/server/tools: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.
2. Define structured log fields: `timestamp`, `component`, `event`, `entityType`, `entityId`, `mapId`, `requestId`.
3. Document when to log state transitions vs. noisy frame updates.

**Validation**
- **Automated:** Unit test log formatter and required fields for representative events.
- **Debug mode:** Human runs app in debug mode and confirms logs are readable, filtered by level, and include map/entity context.

### Step 3 — Add runtime debug flags
**Actions**
1. Define environment flags for client/server/tools (debug on/off, verbose assets, verbose network, simulated latency).
2. Ensure defaults are safe for normal play and explicit for debug.
3. Document all flags in one markdown file.

**Validation**
- **Automated:** Unit tests for flag parsing and default values.
- **Debug mode:** Human toggles flags and confirms behavior changes immediately (extra overlays/log lines/latency simulation).

### Step 4 — Create in-game debug panel requirements
**Actions**
1. Specify a debug panel with sections: map info, entity counts, memory/cache stats, network stats, last API errors.
2. Define required controls: map warp, spawn mob, spawn NPC, clear entities, reload map sections, audio test, packet simulator.
3. Define security rule: debug controls only in debug builds.

**Validation**
- **Automated:** UI/state tests verifying panel visibility by mode and control dispatch events.
- **Debug mode:** Human opens panel, uses each control once, and confirms visible state changes and log entries.

---

## Phase 1 — Repository Restructure (Bun Workspaces)

### Step 5 — Create workspace structure
**Actions**
1. Create directories: `client/`, `server/`, `tools/build-assets/`, `packages/shared-schemas/`.
2. Move existing TypeScript client into `client/` without changing behavior.
3. Configure Bun workspace so all packages resolve correctly.

**Validation**
- **Automated:** Workspace integrity test that installs dependencies and runs package discovery.
- **Debug mode:** Human starts client from new location and verifies login/map flow still works exactly as before.

### Step 6 — Standardize scripts across packages
**Actions**
1. Define consistent scripts: `dev`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck` in all packages.
2. Add top-level scripts that run package scripts in order.
3. Document expected runtime (Bun only).
