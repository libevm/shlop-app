# Progressive Web App Documentation + Findings

This page is the primary documentation page for the project’s docs-as-a-web-app flow.

## Browse docs in a web browser
Start the docs server:

```bash
bun run docs
```

Then open:
- default: `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`
- if that port is busy, use the URL printed in terminal (auto-fallback to next free port).

The docs UI includes sidebar navigation for markdown files under `docs/`.

## PWA docs notes
- A lightweight docs web app is served by `tools/docs/serve-docs.mjs`.
- It includes a web manifest (`/manifest.webmanifest`) and service worker (`/sw.js`) for basic install/offline support.
- This file also keeps the chronological findings/progress log.

## Update policy
- Add an entry after every significant change.
- Keep entries short and chronological (newest first).
- Include what changed, why it matters, and where to look.
- Keep instructions accurate for `bun run docs` browser usage.

### Summary
- Fixed airborne wall collision behavior so jumping into walls blocks horizontal movement.

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js`

### Functional updates
- Removed grounded-only guard from horizontal wall collision resolution.
- Added foothold-below fallback for airborne frames to derive wall-context foothold (C++ `get_fhid_below` intent).
- Result: when moving/jumping into a wall, character no longer keeps moving forward through it.

### Reference alignment
- C++ `FootholdTree::limit_movement` applies horizontal wall limiting for hmobile objects, not just grounded movement.

### Validation
- Automated: `bun run ci` ✅
- Manual route smoke: `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` + `/?mapId=100020000` returns 200 ✅

## 2026-02-17 15:41 (GMT+11)
### Summary
- Ported key C++ ladder/foothold/wall behavior into the web debug client movement loop.
- Restored top-of-ladder `↓` attach behavior so players can climb down from ladder tops.

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js`
- `client/web/index.html`
- `README.md`

### Functional updates
- Added foothold-derived wall/border ranges (matching C++ foothold tree defaults):
  - walls: `left + 25`, `right - 25`
  - borders: `top - 300`, `bottom + 100`
- Reworked wall collision to use C++-style two-hop foothold wall checks (`get_wall` behavior).
- Reworked ladder/rope checks with C++-style semantics:
  - in-range uses ±10 px horizontal with ±5 y probe offset (`up` vs `down`)
  - `felloff` checks determine ladder detach at top/bottom
  - climb cooldown applied after cancel/jump-off
  - jump-off still requires `Space` + (`←` or `→`)
- Top-of-ladder behavior:
  - pressing `↓` while not attached can now grab and climb down ladder/rope if in range.

### Reference scan used for this change
- `MapleStory-Client/Gameplay/Physics/FootholdTree.cpp`

- `MapleStory-Client/Gameplay/MapleMap/MapInfo.{h,cpp}`
- `MapleStory-Client/Character/PlayerStates.cpp`
- `MapleStory-Client/Character/Player.cpp`
- `MapleStory-Client/Gameplay/Stage.cpp`

### Validation
- Automated: `bun run ci` ✅
- Manual route smoke: `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` + `/?mapId=100020000` returns 200 ✅

## 2026-02-17 15:35 (GMT+11)
### Summary
- Refined rope/ladder behavior to match requested controls and removed unwanted top-of-rope re-attach teleport.
- Adjusted rope debug rendering order so rope/ladder guides draw behind the character.

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js`
- `client/web/index.html`
- `README.md`

### Functional updates
- Rope/ladders now render behind the character (`drawRopeGuides()` runs before map/character pass).
- Rope attach behavior changed:
  - not attached: only `↑` can grab rope/ladder
  - not attached: `↓` no longer starts climbing
- Rope jump-off behavior changed:
  - attached: jump-off requires `Space` + (`←` or `→`) together
  - attached: `Space` alone does nothing
  - attached: `←`/`→` alone does nothing
- Top-of-rope behavior changed:
  - pressing `↑` at top no longer snaps/re-attaches the character to rope start.

### Reference scan used for this change
- C++ climb state jump-off condition (`JUMP` + walk input): `MapleStory-Client/Character/PlayerStates.cpp`
- TS half-web climbing context: `MapleWeb/TypeScript-Client/src/MapleCharacter.ts`

### Validation
- Automated: `bun run ci` ✅
- Manual route smoke: `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` + `/?mapId=100020000` returns 200 ✅

## 2026-02-17 15:31 (GMT+11)
### Summary
- Fixed movement lock at foothold edges.
- Walking off a foothold now drops/falls correctly when there is no blocking wall.

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js`

### Functional updates
- Foothold link parsing now treats `prev/next = 0` as no link (`null`) instead of a valid foothold ID.
- Replaced broad wall-crossing drop lock with foothold-link edge rules derived from MapleWeb physics behavior:
  - moving right: block only when linked `next` foothold is vertical and `y1 > y2`
  - moving left: block only when linked `prev` foothold is vertical and `y1 < y2`
- Result: non-wall foothold edges no longer "stick" the player; character can naturally walk off and fall.

### Reference scan used for this change
- TS half-web physics edge logic: `MapleWeb/TypeScript-Client/src/Physics.ts`
- C++ foothold movement-limiting reference: `MapleStory-Client/Gameplay/Physics/FootholdTree.cpp`

### Validation
- Automated: `bun run ci` ✅
- Manual route smoke: `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` + `/?mapId=100020000` returns 200 ✅

## 2026-02-17 15:25 (GMT+11)
### Summary
- Fixed prone (`prone`) pose disappearing in the offline debug client.
- Improved layer-order rendering so map layers can occlude the character similar to C++ `Stage::draw` behavior.

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js`

### Functional updates
- Character action frame parsing now resolves `$uol` part links (e.g. prone -> `../../proneStab/0/body`, `arm`) instead of only direct `$canvas` parts.
- Added foothold layer tracking on landings/top-of-rope transitions.
- Map rendering now draws the character at its current foothold layer during the 0..7 layer pass (instead of always after all layers).
- Result: prone rendering is visible again; upper map layers/background elements can appear in front of the player where expected.

### Reference scan used for this change
- C++: `MapleStory-Client/Gameplay/Stage` draw ordering model (layer pass with characters inside layer traversal)
- C++: `Character/PlayerStates.cpp` climb/jump-off behavior
- TS half-web reference: `MapleWeb/TypeScript-Client` prone/ladder handling context

### Validation
- Automated: `bun run ci` ✅
- Manual route smoke: `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` + `/?mapId=100020000` returns 200 ✅

## 2026-02-17 15:02 (GMT+11)
### Summary
- Updated ladder movement input policy to prevent horizontal movement while attached to rope/ladder.
- Pressing left/right while climbing now performs a side jump-off instead of detaching into a slide/fall.

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js`
- `client/web/index.html`
- `README.md`

### Functional updates
- While climbing:
  - `←`/`→` no longer act as ladder-walk movement.
  - `←`/`→` now trigger jump-off with horizontal impulse.
  - `Space` still jumps off rope/ladder.

### Validation
- Automated: `bun run ci` ✅
- Manual route smoke: `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` + `/?mapId=100020000` returns 200 ✅

## 2026-02-17 14:54 (GMT+11)
### Summary
- Refined wall collision behavior so vertical wall blockers only stop movement when crossing would drop the player into out-of-bounds void.
- Internal walls now allow traversal if there is supporting foothold geometry below on the destination side.

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js`

### Functional updates
- Added ground-below probe for attempted wall crossing.
- Wall collision now applies only when:
  - player is grounded, and
  - crossing side has no foothold below current height (`crossingWouldFallOffMap`).

### Validation
- Automated: `bun run ci` ✅
- Manual route smoke: `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` + `/?mapId=100020000` returns 200 ✅

## 2026-02-17 14:52 (GMT+11)
### Summary
- Added default blink animation cycling for the character face.
- Fixed rope top-exit behavior so climbing up can transition onto the platform instead of sticking at the top.
- Added vertical foothold wall collision checks to reduce walking through map walls/ledge side barriers.

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js`

### Functional updates
- Face animation:
  - default face expression now blinks periodically using `blink` frames/delays from `Face/00020000.img.json`.
- Rope climbing:
  - pressing `↑` at rope top now tries to snap onto nearby foothold and exit climbing state.
- Wall collision:
  - extracts vertical foothold segments as wall lines.
  - blocks horizontal movement when crossing those wall lines at matching Y range.

### Validation
- Automated: `bun run ci` ✅
- Manual route smoke: `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` + `/?mapId=100020000` returns 200 ✅

## 2026-02-17 14:47 (GMT+11)
### Summary
- Updated airborne action behavior to always use `jump` (removed `fly` stance switching).
- Added default face rendering to character composition using `Character.wz/Face/00020000.img.json`.
- Improved anchor placement stability so dependent parts (e.g. face needing `brow` from head) resolve in iterative passes.

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js`

### Functional updates
- Airborne state now maps to `jump` only.
- Character loads default face asset and renders it when frame `face` flag is enabled.
- Face anchors to `brow` map point from head.

### Validation
- Automated: `bun run ci` ✅
- Manual route smoke: `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` + `/?mapId=100020000` returns 200 ✅

## 2026-02-17 14:41 (GMT+11)
### Summary
- Improved character part composition and added rope climbing controls in the offline debug client.
- Addressed jump-arm oddities by switching from fixed arm/hand placement to generalized per-part anchor composition (including `lHand`/`rHand` frames).

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js`
- `client/web/index.html`
- `README.md`
- `docs/process/phase6-runtime-hardening.md`

### Functional updates
- Character composition now:
  - uses frame canvas parts dynamically (`body`, `arm`, `lHand`, `rHand`, etc.)
  - anchors parts via shared `map` vectors
  - applies character-only flip per part
  - includes z-order guidance from `Base.wz/zmap.img.json`
- Rope climbing:
  - `↑`/`↓` near ladder-rope nodes enters climbing
  - climbing uses `ladder` stance
  - `Space` jumps off rope

### Validation
- Automated: `bun run ci` ✅
- Manual web smoke: `CLIENT_WEB_PORT=5210 bun run client:web` + map route load ✅

## 2026-02-17 14:33 (GMT+11)
### Summary
- Added airborne stance switching for the offline web client.
- Character now uses `jump` while rising and `fly` while descending, then returns to `walk1`/`stand1` on landing.

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js`

### Validation
- Automated baseline: `bun run ci` ✅

## 2026-02-17 14:31 (GMT+11)
### Summary
- Fixed major sprite-orientation regression where moving left/right appeared to flip the map instead of the character.
- Updated character rendering to follow MapleWeb-style anchor mapping (`origin` + `map` vectors such as `navel`/`neck`) and added head rendering source from `Character.wz/00012000.img.json`.

### Files changed
- `client/web/app.js` (rendering math and composition updates)

### What was corrected
- World tiles/objects/backgrounds no longer mirror based on facing direction.
